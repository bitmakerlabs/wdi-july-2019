# Debugging

The process of removing errors.

# Intro

'Debugging' is a term popularly attributed to Grace Hopper, after finding a moth in a computer system.

<small>
  (the term 'bug' already existed, but this time it was literally a bug. Now 'bug' is the term software developers use.)

# Debugging and Software Development

Debugging is a part of the software development cycle.

Generally, programming is continual cycle of:

code -> debug -> code -> debug -> ...

--

<br>

Bugs do not mean failure!

--

<br>

You'll probably spend more time debugging than writing your initial code.

--

<br>

It's a skill you can develop and it's worth investing time into it.

# Types of Bugs

## Syntax errors

## Runtime errors

## Logical errors
---


# Syntax errors

  - the easiest to fix
  - error messages are usually clear as to what the problem is and how to fix it
  - often our code won't even begin executing due to these errors
---


# Runtime errors

  - some of our code runs, but then it crashes when it runs into this error
  - a little more difficult to find and fix
---


# Logical errors

  - the hardest to fix
  - often we have to do some introspection into our code to understand what's going on
  - sometimes you may not even notice these errors until well after you've written the code (and are less familiar with the code)

# Avoiding Bugs
---


What are some techniques we can use to avoid bugs from happening?
---


Read and understand the code you write.
---


Write short bits of code at a time. Then run and test it to ensure the code works as expected.
---

layout: false

# Print things to the screen

- `print`

--

`pprint`:

```python
from pprint import pprint

pprint(durations)
```

--

```py
print(durations.__class__)
print(durations.__doc__)
pprint(durations.__dir__())
```
---

layout: true

# More on avoiding bugs
---


Try bits of code in the interactive shell first.
---


Pair programming.

- one person *navigates*: directs the driver where to go and thinks about the larger problem
- one person *drives*: types on the keyboard and thinks more specifically about the exact code being written

--

- the driver should let the navigator control the overall process or they risk the navigator disengaging from the process
- swap out the driver and navigator at regular intervals
---


Organize your code: adhere to the single responsibility principal.

- each class is responsible for one area

- each method does only one thing
---


Example of a method not adhering to the Single Responsibility Principal:

```py
def math(count, function):
  if function == 'add':
    print('adding one to count')
    return count + 1
  elif function == 'subtract':
    print('subtracting one from count')
    return count - 1

print('Setting count to 0')
count = 0

count = math(count, 'add')
count = math(count, 'add')
count = math(count, 'add')
count = math(count, 'subtract')

print("Final Count:")
print(count)
```
---


```py
def add_one(count):
  print('adding one to count')
  return count + 1


def subtract_one(count):
  print('subtracting one from count')
  return count - 1


print('Setting count to 0')
count = 0

count = add_one(count)
count = add_one(count)
count = add_one(count)
count = subtract_one(count)

print("Final Count:")
print(count)
```
---

# Using a Debugger: `pdb`

Use a debugger to set breakpoints and inspect your code.

```py
breakpoint()
```
---

# Using a Debugger: `ipdb`

```py
pip install ipdb
export PYTHONBREAKPOINT=ipdb.set_trace
```
---

layout: true

# Even more on avoiding bugs
---


Keep your code DRY (do not repeat yourself).

*Why does this help?*
---


Use meaningful names (for variables, methods and classes)

*Why does this help?*
---


## Be consistent.

- When calling a method with an argument, use the same variable name in both the caller and the receiver.
---


### Not consistent:

```py
def add(count, amount):
  print(f'adding {amount} to count')
  return count + amount


def subtract(count, number):
  print(f'subtracting {number} from count')
  return number - 1


print('Setting count to 0')
count = 0
num = 3

count = add(count, 1)
count = add(count, 2)
count = add(count, num)
count = subtract(count, 2)

print("Final Count:")
print(count)
```
---


### Consistent:

```py
def add(count, amount):
  print(f'adding {amount} to count')
  return count + amount


def subtract(count, amount):
  print(f'subtracting {amount} from count')
  return amount - 1


print('Setting count to 0')
count = 0
amount = 3

count = add(count, 1)
count = add(count, 2)
count = add(count, amount)
count = subtract(count, 2)

print("Final Count:")
print(count)
```
---


## Other ways to be consistent

### Use full names for variables

### Bad:

```py
anims = ['dog', 'cat', 'bird']
```

### Good:

```py
animals = ['dog', 'cat', 'bird']
```
---


## Other ways to be consistent

### Properly pluralize variables that represent a collection<br>(e.g. `List` or `Dictionary`)

### Bad:

```py
animal = ['dog', 'cat', 'bird']
```

### Good:

```py
animals = ['dog', 'cat', 'bird']
```
---


## Other ways to be consistent

### Name your classes consistently

### Bad:

```py
class Dog:
  sound = 'woof'

class Cat:
  sound = 'meow'

class Animal:
  sound = 'chirp'
```
---


## Other ways to be consistent

### Name your classes consistently

### Good:

```py
class Dog:
  sound = 'woof'

class Cat:
  sound = 'meow'

class Bird:
  sound = 'chirp'
```
---


## Use best practices.

e.g. avoid global variables

*Why are global variables bad?*
---


## Write automated tests for your code

*How do tests help?*

# Searching the web:

## Google

When googling, use your error message, but remove line numbers and anything specific to your program.

For example, if you had this error:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "main.py", line 34, in print_bill
    print_footr(total)
NameError: name 'print_footr' is not defined
```

Then you'd google:

```
NameError: name is not defined
```

*What was removed before googling?*
---


# Searching the web:


## Stackoverflow:

generally it's good to skip the question and go straight to the answers

--

look at the votes for the first two answers

--

focus on the answer that the most votes

- Usually the first answer is useful, but occasionally the second answer will be much better than the first

--

*Example:*

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2349991/how-to-import-other-python-files
---


# Rubber duck debugging

- Explain the problem to someone else -- this process often results in you solving your own problem

or

- You can explain it to an imaginary (or real) rubber duck by your computer
---


# Ask for help

Don't spend longer than ten minutes on a problem.

Ask an instructor or another student for help.

The same advice applies for when you get a job: your employer will want you to be productive. They won't want you to spin your wheels for too long.
---


# Read the docs

*Tip:* you can access Python documentation from the python interactive shell using help:

```py
>>> help([])
>>> help([].append)
```
---


# Read the docs

### Understand how the documentation is structured:

- what methods are available on what class

- how method signatures work

- the return value of methods
---


# Catching Exceptions

```py
numbers = [4, 3, 0, 5]

for number in numbers:
  try:

    print(10 / number )

  except:
    breakpoint()
```
---


# Read the error message

- read it slowly and try to comprehend it completely
- looking for the line number where the error is located
- follow the stack trace

*How does a stack trace work?*
---


# Simplify your code

- break long methods into shorter methods that are easier to reason about
---


# Simplify your code

*For complex bugs:*

Try isolating what you're working on into a separate program and get that working first before integrating it into your larger project.

--

### For example:

If you're having trouble using working with a dictionary:

- try writing a little program with just a single dictionary
- get that working
- ensure you understand how it works
- carry that code over to your larger, real program
---


# Simplify your code

*For complex bugs:*


### Twilio Example:

Twilio is a service that let's you send text messages to people.

Let's say you're trying to integrate this service into a Django app.

- first, write a little Python program in a single file that sends a text message using Twilio
- when that's working, move the code into your main app's codebase
