# How collections and iteration fit into the overall course
---

--

### Week 1: Git, HTML, CSS

--

## Week 2 (this week!):
  Previously: data types, variables, flow control<br>
--
  Yesterday: functions and methods<br>
--
  ***Today!: collections and iteration***<br>
--
  Ttomorrow: problem solving<br>
--
  Next day: Objected Oriented Programming (OOP)<br>

--

### Week 3 and beyond:<br>
OOP, Debugging, Databases, Data-Modelling, Frameworks, Templating, Request-Response, Project Planning, APIs, Testing, JavaScript, React
---

Collections and iteration are a fundamental part of programming, and it's likely you'll use them in almost all future programs you write.

# Transit Planner

We'll explore collections and iteration through a handy transit planner.

# Fare Calculator
---

### Requirements

Create a function that accepts a *list* of passengers and returns the total fare.

### Prices

<pre>
Adult:   3.25<br>
Student: 2.10<br>
Senior:  2.10<br>
Child:   Free<br>
</pre>
---
layout: true

<small>Requirement: create fare calculator function</small>

----
---

First Step: Create an empty list to store passengers and assign it to a variable.

--

### Code

--

```py
passengers = []
```
---

Add one of each type of passenger type to the list using `append` <small>(adult, student, senior, child)</small>.

--

### Code

--

```py
passengers.append('adult')
passengers.append('student')
passengers.append('senior')
passengers.append('child')

print(passengers)
```
---

Create a function called `calculate_total_fare` that accepts a list of passengers and returns the total fare.

For now, leave the body of the function empty.

--

### Code

--

```py
def calculate_total_fare(passengers):
  pass

# -- snip --

total = calculate_total_fare(passengers)

print(f'Total fare: {total}')

```
---

Iterate through the list to find the total fare using a for loop.

For now let's not worry about prices and charge everyone $1

### Code

--

```py
def calculate_total_fare(passengers):

  total = 0

  for passenger in passengers:
    total += 1

  return total
```
---

Add `if` and `elif` statements to calculate appropriate amount for each type of passenger.

--

### Code

--

```py
def calculate_total_fare(passengers):

  total = 0

  for passenger in passengers:
    total += 1
    if passenger == 'adult':
      total += 3.25
    elif passenger == 'student':
      total += 2.10
    elif passenger == 'senior':
      total += 2.10
    elif passenger == 'child':
      pass

  return total
```
---

Format the total to two decimal places using `{:.2f}` along with the `format` string method.

--

### Code

--

```py
formatted_total = '{:.2f}'.format(total)

print(formatted_total)
```
---

Requirement fulfilled!
---
layout: false

Each item in the list is accessible through its `index`.

--

Indexes start at `0` (for the first item in the list) and go up consecutively.

--

Access Each item in the list using `[index #]` beside the variable name.

--

### Code

--

```py
passengers[0]
passengers[1]
passengers[2]
passengers[3]
```
---

Try retrieving an item by `index` that's beyond the last item.

--

### Code

--

```py
passengers[4]
```

--

What happened?
---

## New requirement: Remove senior

It turns out the senior doesn't want to travel with the group any longer.

Let's remove them with `pop` and the `index` of the senior.

--

### Code

--

```py
passengers.pop(2)
```
---

## New requirement: Add two more adults

Your turn:

Use `append` to add the new adults to the list.

--

### Code

--
```py
passengers.append('adult')
passengers.append('adult')
```
---

## New requirement: add new child beside existing child

Another child wants to join, but wants to sit next to the first child.

Use `insert(position, item)` to insert the child at a particular index in the list.

--

### Code

--

```py
passengers.insert(2, 'child')
```
---

## New requirement: orderly fare inspector

The fare inspector wants to ensure everyone has paid their fare and is asking everyone to line up alphabetically by passenger type.

Use `sorted(list)` to return the list sorted, but not mutate the list.

Use `list.sort()` to sort list in place (and return `None`)

--

### Code

--

```py
sorted(passengers) # returns the list sorted, but doesn't modify the original

passengers.sort()  # modifies the original list, and then returns None
```
---

## New requirement: unreasonable fare inspector


The fare inspector doesn't like this order and wants everyone to line up in the opposite order.

Use `list(reversed(list))` to return the list reversed, but not mutate the list.

Use `list.reverse()` to reverse list in place (and return `None`)

--

### Code

--

```py
list(reversed(passengers)) # returns the list reversed, but doesn't modify the original

passengers.reverse()       # reverses the original list, and then returns None
```
---

Oh no! It looks like the second and third passengers don't have a Proof-of-Payment

Let's find out who they are using a `slice[slice_start:slice_end]`

`slice_start` is the index of the beginning of the slice.

`slice_end` is the index following the end of the slice.

### Code

--

```py
print(passengers[1:3])
```
---
layout: true

# Dictionaries
---

### A data type that stores key-value pairs

Create them with `{}`
---

### Create a few example stations and what lines they're on

```py
stations = {}

stations['Finch']       = 'line 1'
stations['Main Street'] = 'line 2'
stations['Midland']     = 'line 3'
stations['Leslie']      = 'line 4'

print(stations)
```
---

### What line is Leslie station on?

### Code

--

```py
stations['Leslie']
```
---

Let's import all the stations and their line numbers:

### Code

```
from data import stations_with_line_numbers
```

--

... and print them out:

```py
print(stations_with_line_numbers)
```
---

## Let's print them out a little neater:

### Code


```py
for station, line_number in stations_with_line_numbers.items():
  print(line_number + ': ' + station)
```
---

## Let's print out stations that are on line three:

### Code

--

```py
for station, line_number in stations_with_line_numbers.items():
  if line_number == 'Line 3':
    print(station)
```
---

## Let's see what lines are available

### Code

--
```py
set(stations.values())
```
---

## Let's see just the station names

```py
stations.keys()
```
---
layout: false

# Ranges

- let's print out stations organized by line using a `range`
---

# Other Exercises

- what stations have bathrooms?

- what stations are accessible?

- what stations have bathrooms and are accessible?

- what stations start with the letter 'B'?
---
