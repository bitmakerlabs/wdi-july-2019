## Fix It: HTML

Each of the HTML files provided renders a web page, but has something wrong with the code.  We'll be using an HTML validator to help us fix the code.

## Getting started

[Fork and clone this repo](https://git.generalassemb.ly/wdi-toronto/validating-html) containing four HTML files.  Each one renders a web page, but has something wrong with the code.  

## Exercise

Go through each HTML file one by one:

1. Paste the HTML into this [HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea)
2. Discover what the problem is
3. Fix the code in the HTML file
4. Commit your changes

## Submitting

When you're done, push your commits to github, click on "view submissions" in upper right-hand corner of this page, and paste in the link to your github repo.

### Check your understanding

- What does `title` do?
- What information do images need, and why?
- What's the difference between `head` and `body`?
- Based on the messages from the validator, write the bare-minimum HTML you need to have a "valid" web page.
