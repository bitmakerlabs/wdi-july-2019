## Prerequisites
* git fundamentals
* HTML fundamentals

## Learning Goals
* tag/element selectors
* class selectors
* id selectors
* descendent selectors
* specificity

## Getting started

You'll need to **fork** the following repository onto your GitHub account.

1. Visit this link: https://git.generalassemb.ly/wdi-toronto/css-selectors
2. Click the "Fork" button at the top right

This will make a copy of the repository your account.

From there, you'll want to **clone** that repository to your computer.

1. Click on the green "Clone or download" button
2. Copy the URL in the box that appears
3. Switch to your Terminal window
4. Navigate to the folder where you keep your General Assembly projects (e.g. `~/Desktop/ga/projects`)
5. Type `git clone <paste the URL you copied here>` and hit enter
6. Change directories into your newly cloned project folder (`cd css-selectors`)
7. Open the `index.html` file by double clicking
8. Go to your browser, `cmd-o` (mac) / `ctrl-o` (linux) to open `index.html` in your browser

## Instructions

The assignment instructions are written directly in `index.html`. **Before you make any changes read through the code first!** You'll find comments in the code that will help you explore the difference between CSS Reset and Normalize before you begin working with the CSS selectors.

### Workflow

First you'll need to link `styles.css` to `index.html`.

* Read the exercise instructions in `index.html`
* Write your code in `styles.css`
* Refresh your browser to see if your changes worked
* Repeat for next exercise


## Submit your assignment

When you're done playing around with this document, submit the link to your repository on the submissions tab above.


## Stretch: Add web fonts to the page

Rather than using a font stack based on built-in fonts, you can use web fonts to broaden the possible fonts and customize your document to your design. Take a look at https://fonts.google.com/ and figure out how to use the fonts listed there in your document.
