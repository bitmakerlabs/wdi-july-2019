# Inheritance

In OOP, classes can be created based on other classes.

A class based on another class is called a subclass or child class.

The class the subclass was based on is called a parent class or superclass.

Child classes have all the methods and attributes of their parents.

Child classes can overwrite the methods of their parent classes.

Inheritance can be used to keep code "DRY", e.g. "Don't Repeat Yourself".

Inheritance, when not done correctly, can cause code to become coupled and can be difficult to main or understand.

In a not very scientific hierarchy chart of life, imagine each class having the attributes of its parents, plus its own that make it unique.

# Exercise: Dog classes

Create a `Dog` class  with three methods:

`__init__`: accepts and sets the name of the dog

`make_sound`: prints out "woof"

`eat`: print out "(dog name) eats some food"

Create three child classes: `Greyhound`, `Husky`, and `Poodle`

For the `Poodle`, have it make the sound `yip`.

For the `Greyhound`, have it eat `a lot` of food.
---


# Exercise: Life

Create a `Life`, and child classes for `Plant`, `Animal` and `Insect`.

On `Life`, create an `__init__` method that accepts and sets the `type`.

Also on `Life`, create a `describe` method that just prints out `(type) is okay`.

On the child classes, overwrite the `describe` methods with the following:

`Plant`: "(type) is nice to look at"

`Animal`: "(type) is cuddly"

`Insect`: "(type) is creepy"

Create some instances of each class and call the `describe` method on each.

# "is a" vs "has a"

When structuring your program using inheritance, it's good to ask if the relationship between parent and child is an "is a" or a "has a" relationship.

"is a" relationships are good candidates for inheritance, where as with a "has a", inheritance is likely not an ideal solution.

For example:

A Car "is a" Vehicle.

A Car "has" Wheels.

In this situation, Car inheriting from Vehicle makes sense, but inheriting from Wheel does not.
---


# "is a" vs "has a"

Another example:

"Checkings Account" and "Savings Account" could inherit from "Account", but a "Transaction" would be it's own independent class and neither a parent nor child of any type of "Account".
---


# Super

Calling `super` passes flow control to the parent class.

The syntax is:

`super().__init__(var1, var2)`
---


# Exercise: Shopping Cart

Create a `Product` class and a `Book` subclass.

The product class should keep track of the name and price, and set the tax to 10% (0.10).
It should have a total method that includes the price and tax.

The Book subclass should call super in the `__init__` method. As well, it should overwrite the tax with 0%.

Create a `shopping_cart` array and add a few items and print the total out.
---


# Exercise: Create more products

Create some more children of products: `Food` (5% tax) and `Pet` (20% tax).
---


# Exercise: Report

Create a `Report` class that accepts a title, author, intro, data and summary.

Create child classes for:

- a Plain Text Report
-  HTML Report
- CSV File
---


# Multiple Inheritance

In Python, a class can inherit from multiple classes.
