## Positioning Basics

We're just going play around with some basic positioning rules to ensure that we understand the fundamentals.

### Prerequisites

* HTML and CSS fundamentals
* You _don't_ have to have completed the CSS grid assignments in order to attempt this one

### Learning Goals
* The use of `position` and related CSS properties


### Getting Started

[The starter code for this assignment can be found in this folder

The goal is to make your final version look like the final image in this folder called final.png.

### Tasks
1. Make all the positioning for the boxes relative to the div with class `container`
2. Set the position of the `.blue` box to be `50px` down and `200px` to the right of it's static (original) position
3. Position the `.red` box absolutely `50px` from the top and `100px` from the right of its container
4. Position the `.green` box absolutely `50px` from the bottom and `50%` from the right of its container
5. Position the `.orange` box absolutely `75%` from the top and `25%` from the left of its container
6. Fix the `.yellow` box to the bottom of the window. Make sure it starts at the left side and spans the entire width of the page, and that it stays there when you scroll the page.
7. Ensure that the blue box remains on top of all of the other boxes (this is where `z-index` comes in!)

**Note** Depending on the width of your browser window, it may not look exactly the same as the image above when you're done. To ensure it matches up, resize your window until they look alike.
