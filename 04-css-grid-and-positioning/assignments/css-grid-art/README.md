## CSS Grid Art

For this exercise, you will be creating an abstract work of art using CSS Grid!  More specifically, you will be attempting to recreate a piece called *Composition with Red Blue and Yellow* by Piet Mondrian.  

## Prerequisites
* HTML and CSS fundamentals

## Learning Goals
* CSS grid (`display: grid` and its associated properties)

### Getting Started

Open this folder in your editor, and open `index.html` in your browser. Open the dev tools within your browser so you can experiment.

At first glance you should see something that kind of resembles the shape of the original painting but is a bit off.  Use the numbers to help you with the order and update your `style.css` file to resize and recolor your `div`s.  The first one has been done for you.  

**You will only need to edit `style.css`** to complete the exercise. You don't need to recreate the image exactly - there's a lot of subtlety here! (You can also get rid of the numbers in the `index.html` file if you'd like, they are there to help you)

Use the painting of the image in the img folder or check out one possible solution in that folder for guidance.  

### Bonus!

Create your own Mondrian-inspired works of art using CSS Grid from scratch!
