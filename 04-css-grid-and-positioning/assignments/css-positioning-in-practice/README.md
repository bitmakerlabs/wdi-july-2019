## Prerequisites

* This assignment assumes you have completed the intro to positioning assignment


## Learning Goals
* CSS `position` and related properties

## Getting Started

[The starter code for this assignment can be found in this folder.

### Tasks
The final version you're trying to recreate is in this folder called final.png.

TODO add raw image url

![Final Version](https://github.com/bitmakerlabs/css-positioning/raw/master/part-2-final.png)

The plan is to make yours look as close to the final version as possible. The key features are:

- The watch later (clock) icon is positioned at the top right of the poster
  - I set mine `8px` down and `8px` from the right, but you can choose whatever looks best to you!
- The action icons (bookmark, heart and star) are positioned at the bottom right of the card
  - I set mine `8px` up and `8px` from the right, but you can choose whatever looks best to you!
