## Positioning in Practice

In this part, you'll be creating film cards with actions that should be specifically positioned. This will require you to use the `display` and box model skills you learned, as well as the `position` property from today.

## Prerequisites

* This assignment assumes you have completed the intro to positioning assignment.


## Learning Goals
* CSS `position` and related properties

## Getting Started

[The starter code for this assignment can be found here in the part 2 directory](https://git.generalassemb.ly/wdi-toronto/css-positioning)

### Tasks
Here's the final version you're trying to recreate:

![Final Version](https://raw.git.generalassemb.ly/wdi-toronto/course_materials/master/04-css-grid-and-positioning/assignments/css-positioning-in-practice/final.png)

The plan is to make yours look as close to the final version as possible. The key features are:

- The watch later (clock) icon is positioned at the top right of the poster
  - I set mine `8px` down and `8px` from the right, but you can choose whatever looks best to you!
- The action icons (bookmark, heart and star) are positioned at the bottom right of the card
  - I set mine `8px` up and `8px` from the right, but you can choose whatever looks best to you!

## Submitting
