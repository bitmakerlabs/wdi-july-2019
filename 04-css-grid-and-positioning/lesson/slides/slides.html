## `position: static;`

- by default, all elements are positioned as static

--

- the `top`, `bottom`, `right`, and `left` properties have no effect on statically positioned elements

--

- we usually don't explicitly position something as static, as it's the default

---


## `position: relative;`
- creates a positioning context around the element

--

- you can see this context using the chrome dev tools

--

- instructs the element to obey the `top`, `bottom`, `right`, and `left` properties

--

- the `top`, `bottom`, `right`, and `left` properties accept the various CSS units: `px`, `em`, `%`

--

- the `top`, `bottom`, `right`, and `left` properties accept negative numbers

--

- usually we don't specify the `top`, `bottom`, `right`, and `left` for `position: relative`, but rather we use `position: relative` when we want to create a context for inner `absolute` elements to be positioned

---


## `position: absolute;`

- takes the element out of the regular html flow, and positions according to the nearest parent contained that is positioned as `relative`, `absolute` or `fixed`

--

- instructs the element to obey the `top`, `bottom`, `right`, and `left` properties

---


## `position: fixed;`

- like `position: absolute` but context is never parent element but rather is always the browser window

--

- fixed position elements on the page will remain as other elements scroll by

---


## `z-index`

- controls z-axis (front to back)

--

- used for stacking elements on top of other elements

--

- natural `z-index` is order of elements in document

--

- the higher the `z-index`, the closer to the top of the stack it is

--

- default `z-index` for elements is `0`

--

- elements with `z-index` set are contained within parent elements that have `z-index` set

--

- elements must be positioned with `relative`, `absolute` or `fixed` or else a `z-index` property will be ignored

--

- `z-index` accepts negative numbers, although those can be difficult to work with
