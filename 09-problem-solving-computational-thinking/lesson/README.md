So far we've talk about how the fundamental build blocks of programming work, including variables, arrays, hashes, iteration, if/else statements, methods, arguments, and return values.  But knowing the *what* and *how* isn't the hard part - the hard part is knowing *why* and *when* to apply each of these concepts when you're presented with any given programming task.

##  Agenda
* What is computational thinking
  * Decomposition
  * Pattern matching
  * Abstraction
  * Algorithms
* Researching technical problems
* Pseudocode
* Problem solving thought process

### Researching Technical Problems

1. google the error message, removing any parts that are specific to your problem (e.g. specific variable names)
2. describe the problem

#### Preferred Sources
+ Stack Overflow
+ Official documentation

#### Other Sources
+ Other forums besides Stack Overflow
+ Tutorials
+ Blog posts

#### Stack Overflow
* date
* upvotes / green "accepted" check mark
* comments saying the solution helped
* skip the question and only go back to read it if you need the context to understand the answer or which parts of it are relevant/irrelevant to you
* go to official documentation to learn more about any methods mentioned

####  Reading the Python Docs
```
function_name(required_argument, optional_argument=default_value)

function_name([optional_argument])

functional_name(*as_many_args_as_you_want)

```

* most of the time, skim the description for the **return value** and info about what to pass as arguments, then go to Python and try it out yourself
* sometimes returning to read the description more carefully _after_ having tried it in the Python shell can provide better insight
