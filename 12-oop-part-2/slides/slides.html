---

# What is OOP?

--

- a programming paradigm in which we structure our programs into objects
---

# What is an object?

--

- in OOP, objects are  abstractions that represent real word objects and behaviours

--

- an object can represent anything. for example:

 - a dog, house, boat
 - walking, building, sailing
 - deposit_into_account, blue, italics
--

- objects can hold both values (attributes) and methods

--

- an object is a general term that can represent a **class** or an **instance** of a class
---

# What is a class?

--

- a blueprint for any ***instance*** created with it

--

- a class also holds functionality common to the collection of instances created with it

--

- only one class of a particular type can exist in a program
---

# How is a class created?

--

Classes are created by defining them with the `class` keyword.

```py
class MyClass:
  pass
```
---

# What is an instance?

--

Objects that are created (instantiated) from a class's blueprint.

--

Each instance is unique.

--

Many instances based on the same class can exist in a program.
---

# How is an instance created?

--

Instance methods are created by putting round brackets `()` beside the class name.

```py
my_instance = MyClass()
```
---


# What is a constructor method?

--

The constructor method is automatically invoked when an instance is created.

--

In python, this is the `__init__` method.

```py
class MyClass:

  def __init__(self):
    print("I get called when I'm instantiated")
```
---

# What is an instance method?

--

Instance methods define behaviours and have access to themselves through `self`.
---

# How is an instance method created?

--

Instance methods are created by defining a method and using `self` as the first argument.

```py
class MyClass:

  def my_instance_method(self):
    pass
```

--

*Note:* `self` is just used by convention. Technically, any argument name could be used to capture a particular instance into a variable.
---

# How is an instance method invoked?

--

Instance methods are invoked by using dot notation and brackets.

- the dot is between the instance variable name and the method
- the brackets follow the method


```py
class MyClass:

  def my_instance_method(self):
    print('I am an instance method')

my_instance = MyClass()
my_instance.my_instance_method()
```
---

# What is an instance attribute?

Instance attributes are values (properties) attached to a particular instance.
---

# How is an instance attribute set?

--

Instance attributes are set by using a `self.attribute = 'value'` syntax.

```py
class MyClass:

  def __init__(self):
    self.value = 0
```
---

# How is an instance attribute retrieved?

Instance attributes are retrieved by using `my_instance.attribute` syntax.

--

Within the instance, this would be `self.attribute`.

--

Outside the instance, this would be `my_instance.attribute`

```py
class Account:

  def __init__(self):
    self.amount = 100

  def amount_formatted(self):
    return "${0:.2f}".format(self.amount)

account = Account()

print(account.amount_formatted())
```

# Artwork Exercise
---

Create a ***class*** called `Art` for a piece of artwork.

We should keep track of the name, artist and value of the artwork.

Create a `__str__` method that displays the object when printed like so:

"The Starry Night by Vincent van Gogh valued at $10.00"

### Sample Data:

- The Starry Night by Vincent van Gogh valued at $10.00
- Infinity Mirrors by Yayoi Kusama valued at $50.00
- The Wounded Deer by Frida Kahlo valued at $35.99
---

```py
class Art:

  def __init__(self, name, artist, value):
    self.name   = name
    self.artist = artist
    self.value  = value

  def value_formatted(self):
    return "${0:.2f}".format(self.value)

  def __str__(self):
    return f'{self.name} by {self.artist} valued at {self.value_formatted()}'

starry_night     = Art('The Starry Night', 'Vincent van Gogh', 10.00)
infinity_mirrors = Art('Infinity Mirrors', 'Yayoi Kusama',     50.00)
wounded_deer     = Art('The Wounded Deer', 'Frida Kahlo',      35.99)

print(starry_night)
```

# Artwork Exercise: Your Turn
---

<div>

Create a `Gallery` class that has the name and city of a gallery.
<br>
<br>
Create an `artwork` attribute for each gallery. It should start off as an empty array.
<br>
<br>
Create an `add` method that accepts a piece of artwork and adds the object to the `artwork` array.
<br>
<br>
Create a `print_inventory` method that displays the gallery name and the name of each piece of artwork.

</div>

```py
ago = Gallery('Art Gallery of Ontario', 'Toronto')

ago.add(infinity_mirrors)
ago.add(wounded_deer)

ago.print_inventory()
```
<div>
Output:
</div>

```
Art Gallery of Ontario Inventory

Infinity Mirrors
The Wounded Deer
```
---

```py
class Gallery:

  def __init__(self, name, city):
    self.name    = name
    self.city    = city
    self.artwork = []

  def add(self, gallery):
    self.artwork.append(gallery)

  def print_inventory(self):
    print(self.name)
    print()

    for art in self.artwork:
      print(art.name)
```

# What is a class method?

--

A class method is a method that knows about itself (the class) as a whole.

--

Class methods don't have direct access to their own instances.
---

# How is a class method created?

--

A class method is created by putting the `@classmethod` decorator above the method definition.

--

A decorator is a function that takes another function and extends its behaviour.

--

A class method's first argument represents the class.

--

By convention, this argument is `cls`.

```py
class MyClass:

  @classmethod
  def my_class_method(cls):
    print("I am a class method.")
```
---

# How is a class method invoked?

--

Class methods are invoked by using dot notation and brackets.

- the dot is between the class and the method
- the brackets follow the method

```py
class MyClass:

  @classmethod
  def my_class_method(cls):
    print('I am class method')

MyClass.my_class_method()
```
---

# What is a class attribute?

--

A class attribute is a value or property that applies to the entire class.
---

# How is a class attribute set?

--

By defining the value with the body of the class.

The attribute should not be within a method.

```py
class MyClass:

  my_class_attribute = "I am a class attribute"
```
---

# How is a class attribute retrieved

--

Class attributes are retrieved by using dot notation between the class and the attribute.

```py
class MyClass:

  my_class_attribute = 'hello'

print(MyClass.my_class_attribute)
```

Notice that unlike methods, brackets are not used when retrieving the value of them.
---

# Gallery Report Exercise

Extend the `Gallery` class with a `report` method.

The `report` method displays the number of galleries in each city.

The city list is sorted by number of galleries they each have.

Given the following data:

```py
ago          = Gallery('Art Gallery of Ontario',         'Toronto')
louvre       = Gallery('Louvre',                         'Paris')
paris_modern = Gallery('Paris Museum of Modern Art',     'Paris')
pompidou     = Gallery('The Centre Pompidou',            'Paris')
nyc_modern   = Gallery('The Metropolitan Museum of Art', 'New York')
guggenheim   = Gallery('Guggenheim Museum',              'New York')

Gallery.report()
```

The output would be:

```
Toronto: 1
New York: 2
Paris: 3
```
---

```py
class Gallery:

  galleries = []

  def __init__(self, name, city):
    self.name    = name
    self.city    = city
    self.artwork = []
    Gallery.galleries.append(self)

  def add(self, gallery):
    self.artwork.append(gallery)

  @classmethod
  def report(cls):
    for city, number in cls.sorted_cities():
      print(f'{city}: {number}')

  @classmethod
  def cities(cls):
    result = {}

    for gallery in cls.galleries:
      city = gallery.city
      if result.get(city):
        result[city] += 1
      else:
        result[city] = 1

    return result

  @classmethod
  def sorted_cities(cls):
    return sorted(cls.cities().items(), key=lambda city: city[1])
```
---

# Gallery Report Exercise: Your Turn

Create two class methods:

`most_artiest` returns the city with the most galleries.

`least_artiest` returns the city with the least galleries.

```py
print(f'Least artiest: {Gallery.least_artiest()}') # Toronto

print(f'Most artiest: {Gallery.most_artiest()}')   # Paris
```
---

```py
class Gallery:

  # -- snip --

  @classmethod
  def least_artiest(cls):
    return cls.sorted_cities()[0][0]

  @classmethod
  def most_artiest(cls):
    return list(reversed(cls.sorted_cities()))[0][0]
```
---

# What is a magic method?

--

Magic methods are invoked when objects are passed into python built-in functions.

--

They are sometimes referred to as 'special', 'double underscore' or 'dunder' methods.
---

# How are magic methods used?

--

Magic methods are invoked when objects are passed into certain python built-ins.

```py
from datetime import datetime

class Email:

  def __init__(self, sender, recipient, subject, body, signature):
    self.datetime  = datetime.now()
    self.sender    = sender
    self.recipient = recipient
    self.subject   = subject
    self.body      = body
    self.signature = signature

  def __len__(self):
    return len(self.body + self.signature)


email = Email('sean@bitmaker.co',
              'example@gmail.com',
              'Hey!',
              'Lorem ipsum',
              '\nKind regards,\nSean')

print(len(email))
```
---

# City Class Sorted Exercise

Create a city class and use the `__lt__` magic method to allow them to be sorted.

`__lt__` is for "**l**ess **t**han" or `<`.

This method should accept `self` and `other` and return a comparison of the number of galleries in each city.

```py
toronto  = City('Toronto')
paris    = City('Paris')
new_york = City('New York')

cities   = [toronto, paris, new_york]

toronto.galleries.append(Gallery('Art Gallery of Ontario'))
paris.galleries.append(Gallery('Louvre'))
paris.galleries.append(Gallery('Paris Museum of Modern Art'))
paris.galleries.append(Gallery('The Centre Pompidou'))
new_york.galleries.append(Gallery('The Metropolitan Museum of Art'))
new_york.galleries.append(Gallery('Guggenheim Museum'))

print(cities)         # [Toronto, Paris, New York]
print(sorted(cities)) # [Toronto, New York, Paris]
```
---

```py
class City:

  def __init__(self, name):
    self.name      = name
    self.galleries = []

  def __repr__(self):
    return self.name

  def __lt__(self, other):
    return len(self.galleries) < len(other.galleries)

class Gallery:

  def __init__(self, name):
    self.name = name
```
---

# City Class: Your turn

Implement the ability to add cities together.

Adding two cities will return the total number of galleries in both cities.

Use the magic method `__add__` to do this.

```py
print(toronto + new_york) # 3
print(paris + new_york)   # 5
```
---

```py
class City:

  # -- snip --

  def __add__(self, other):
    return len(self.galleries) + len(other.galleries)

  # -- snip --
```
---
