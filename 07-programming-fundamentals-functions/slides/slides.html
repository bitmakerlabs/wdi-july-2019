---

Functions and methods are a fundamental part of programming, and it's likely you'll use them in almost all future programs you write

---
layout: false

# Built-ins, Functions, Methods

> Routines that store callable code<br>
    (code that can be executed)

--

- **Built-ins** are always available functions that are built into the python language:<br>
https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html

--

- **User-defined functions** are functions you create -- this is what we'll be primarily focusing on today

--

- **Methods** are similar to functions, except they're attached to objects

---

# B is for Bacon Bill

We'll explore methods and functions through a restaurant bill creator


---

# Requirements

***Create a simple bill for our restaurant.***

--

- we only sell one thing: bacon

--

- limit one per customer

--

- we need a function to print this out for each customer

---
layout: true
# Simple Bill

---

## Sample

<pre>
B IS FOR BACON

-----------------
2.00 Bacon
-----------------

Please Come Again!
</pre>

---


## Code

--

```py

# Define method

def print_bill():
  print()
  print('B IS FOR BACON')
  print()
  print('------------------------')
  print('2.00 Bacon')
  print('------------------------')
  print()
  print('Please Come Again!')
  print()


# Print three bills

print_bill()
print_bill()
print_bill()

```

---
layout: false

### What was involved in creating this function?

--

- we used the keyword `def` to define the function

--

- `def` was followed by the function name, brackets, and a colon:
```py
def print_bill():
```

--

- the code that makes up the function's body must be indented

--

### Does defining a function also execute it?

--

- no, `def` does not call the function, it only defines it to be called later


---

### How do we call (execute) the function?

--

- to call the function, we use the function's name along with round brackets `()`:
```py
print_bill()
```

---

### What happens if we define and then type the function name without round brackets in our REPL?

--

```py
>>> def print_header():
...   print('B IS FOR BACON')
..
>>> print_header

# what's the REPL report back here?
```

---

### What's REPL an acronym for?

--
> READ-EVALUATE-PRINT-LOOP

--

### What is a REPL?

--

A simple, interactive computer programming environment that:

<pre>
1) provides a prompt to take inputs (READ)
2) executes the inputs              (EVALUATE)
3) returns the result               (PRINT)
4) goes back to `1`                 (LOOP)
</pre>

---


### Many programming languages provide REPLs

Simple math using JavaScript (`node`), Ruby (`irb`), and Python's (`python3`) REPLs:

```sh
❯ node
> 3 * 4
12
>

❯ irb
irb(main):001:0> 3 * 5
=> 15
irb(main):002:0>

❯ python3
Python 3.7.2 (default, Jan 13 2019, 12:50:15)
[Clang 10.0.0 (clang-1000.11.45.5)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information
>>> 3 * 7
21
>>>
```

Tip: `control+d` will usually exit the REPL

---

### What is `print`?

--

a ***built-in*** python function for writing (usually to your screen, but could be used to write to a file, network, printer, etc.)

--
### What is an `argument`?

--

data we pass into a function

---

### What's an example of an argument we passed into the `print` function?

--
```py
'B IS FOR BACON'
```

--

### Why did we sometimes not pass arguments into `print`?

--

We wanted to print a blank line

---

### Where can we find documentation for `print`?

--

[https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print)

--


### What built-in could we use in our python REPL to get `print` documentation?

[https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html)

--


```py
help(print)
```

# New Requirement

*** allow us to bill for Veggie Bacon ***

---
layout: true

# Veggie Bacon

---

## Sample bill with Veggie Bacon

--

<pre>
B IS FOR BACON

-----------------
2.00 Veggie Bacon
-----------------

Please Come Again!
</pre>

---


## Code

--

```py
def print_bill(item):
  print()
  print('B IS FOR BACON')
  print()
  print('------------------------')
  print('2.00 {}'.format(item))
  print('------------------------')
  print()
  print('Please Come Again!')
  print()


print_bill('Bacon')
print_bill('Veggie Bacon')
```

---


### What does `format` allow us to do with our string?

--

It allows us to insert variables into a string


---

### What happens if we call `print_bill` without passing in an argument?

--

We receive an error:
```bash
TypeError: print_bill() missing 1 required positional argument: 'item'
```

---
layout: false

# New Requirement

*** Default item to Bacon ***

--

- we sell much more `Bacon` than `Veggie Bacon`
- make the item default to `Bacon` if no argument is passed in

---
layout: true

# Default to 'Bacon'

---


## Code

--

```py
def print_bill(item='Bacon'):
  print()
  print('B IS FOR BACON')
  print()
  print('------------------------')
  print('2.00 {}'.format(item))
  print('------------------------')
  print()
  print('Please Come Again!')
  print()


print_bill('Veggie Bacon')
print_bill()
```

---

### What's the advantage of providing a default item?

--

We don't need to pass in `'Bacon'` every time (our most common use case)


---
layout: false

## New Requirement

*** Add ability to customize the price ***

---
layout: true

# Flexible Price

--

- we would like the charge a different price for veggie bacon


---


## Code

--

```py
def print_bill(price='2.00', item='Bacon'):
  print()
  print('B IS FOR BACON')
  print()
  print('------------------------')
  print('{} {}'.format(price, item))
  print('------------------------')
  print()
  print('Please Come Again!')
  print()


print_bill('1.50', 'Veggie Bacon')
print_bill()
```

---

### If during the evening, they want to charge $4.00 for bacon, how would they call the `print_bill` function?

--

```py
print_bill('4.00', 'Bacon')
```

---
layout: false

# New Requirement

***we would like to sell more than one item to each customer***

- everything will be $2.00 per item
- we no longer need flexible pricing
- the bill will need to calculate the total
- we no longer need the default item to be 'Bacon'

---
layout: true

# Multiple Items Per Bill

---

## Sample bill with multiple items

--

<pre>
B IS FOR BACON

-----------------
2.00 Bacon
2.00 Bacon
2.00 Veggie Bacon
-----------------
6.00 TOTAL

Please Come Again!
</pre>

---

### Let's take this step by step

---

### First, let's create separate functions for the different bill sections:

- create the following functions:
  - `print_header`
  - `print_item`
  - `print_footer`

- and call each of those functions from within `print_bill`

---

### `print_header` Code:

--

```py
def print_header():
  print()
  print('B IS FOR BACON')
  print()
  print('------------------------')
```

---

### `print_item` Code:
--

```py
def print_item(price, item):
  print('{} {}'.format(price, item))
```

---

### `print_footer` Code:

--

```py
def print_footer(price):
  print('------------------------')
  print('{} TOTAL'.format(price))
  print()
  print('Please Come Again!')
  print()
```

---

### `print_bill` Code:

--

```py
def print_bill(price='2.00', item='Bacon'):
  print_header()
  print_item(price, item)
  print_footer(price)
```

---

### Altogether:

--

```py
def print_header():
  print()
  print('B IS FOR BACON')
  print()
  print('------------------------')

def print_item(price, item):
  print('{} {}'.format(price, item))

def print_footer(price):
  print('------------------------')
  print('{} TOTAL'.format(price))
  print()
  print('Please Come Again!')
  print()

def print_bill(price='2.00', item='Bacon'):
  print_header()
  print_item(price, item)
  print_footer(price)

print_bill('1.50', 'Veggie Bacon')
```

---

### Now let's remove the flexible pricing, and change everything back to $2.00

---

### Code

--

```py
def print_header():
  print()
  print('B IS FOR BACON')
  print()
  print('------------------------')

def print_item(item):
  print('2.00 {}'.format(item))

def print_footer(price):
  print('------------------------')
  print('{} TOTAL'.format(price))
  print()
  print('Please Come Again!')
  print()

def print_bill(item='Bacon'):
  print_header()
  print_item(item)
  print_footer()

print_bill('Veggie Bacon')
```

---

### Now let's remove the default item

---

### Code

--

```py
def print_header():
  print()
  print('B IS FOR BACON')
  print()
  print('------------------------')

def print_item(item):
  print('2.00 {item}'.format(item))

def print_footer():
  print('------------------------')
  print('2.00 TOTAL')
  print()
  print('Please Come Again!')
  print()

def print_bill(item):
  print_header()
  print_item(item)
  print_footer()

print_bill('Veggie Bacon')
```
---

### Now let's add the ability to pass in multiple items

---

### Code


```py
def print_bill(*items):
  print_header()

  for item in items:
    print_item(item)

  print_footer()

print_bill('Bacon', 'Bacon', 'Veggie Bacon')
```

---

### What does the `*` in `*items` allow us to do with our arguments?

--

It allows us to pass in any number of arguments and puts them into a single `list` called `items`

--

### What does `for item in items:` do?

--

- It loops through each element in our list called `items`

- It creates a temporary local variable called `item` that is used for the iteration of the loop

- It assigns the `item` variable the value of the element it is currently iterating over

---

### Now let's properly total the bill

Let's create a separate function for totalling the bill called `calculate_total`

---

### Code


```py
def calculate_total(items):
  total = 0

  for item in items:
    total = total + 2.00

  return total
```

---

### We'll need to call `calculate_total` from our `print_bill` function

--

### Code

--

```py
def print_bill(*items):
  total = calculate_total(items)

  print_header()

  for item in items:
    print_item(item)

  print_footer()
```

---

### What does `return` do in `calculate_total`?

--

It returns the value of `total` to the calling function

--

### What does `total =` do in the statement `total = calculate_total(items)`

It assigns the return value of `calculate_total` to the variable `total`

--

### What can we do to see if `total` is the correct value?

--

We can print total out after we calculate it:

```py
total = calculate_total(items)
print(total)
```

---

### What would the return value of our function be if we didn't say `return` at the end of it?

--

It would be `None`, which is a special python object representing the absence of a value

---

### How do make the footer print out the correct total?

--

Pass `total` in as an argument to `print_footer` and have it print it out

---

### Code

--

```py
def print_bill(*items):
  total = calculate_total(items)

  # ... snip ..

  print_footer(total)

def print_footer(total):
  print('------------------------')
  print('{} TOTAL'.format(total))
  print()
  print('Please Come Again!')
  print()
```

---

Currently our footer looks like this:

```plain
------------------------
6.0 TOTAL

Please Come Again!
```

--

### How do we format our price with the correct number of decimals?<br>(so ***6.0*** prints out as ***6.00***)

--

We can use `.format` on our string with `:.2f` as the format

---

### Code

--


```py
def print_footer(total):
  print('------------------------')
  print('{:.2f} TOTAL'.format(total))
  print()
  print('Please Come Again!')
  print()
```

---

### What does `:.2f` do to the number?

--

- The `f` makes the number a `float`, which is a number that has a decimal place to allow for more precision
- The `2` formats the number with 2 values after the decimal place

--

### What would happen if we used `:.4f` instead?

--

It would format the number to 4 values after the decimal place

---
layout: true

# Functions vs Methods

---


### Is `.format` a ***function*** or a ***method***?

--

It's a method

--

### What's the difference between a function and a method?

--

Functions are executable code not attached to objects

Methods are executable code attached to objects

---


### What kind of object is `.format` attached to?

```py
'{:.2f} TOTAL'.format(total)
```

--

A string

--

### How can we verify what type of object `'{:.2f} TOTAL'` is?

--

```py
'{:.2f} TOTAL'.__class__
```

---

### How can we verify what type of object `.format` is?

--

```py
''.format
```

--

### How can we verify what type of object `print` is?

--

```py
print
```

---

### Will people (including us instructors) accidentally mix up the terms `function` and `method` and add to the confusion?

--

Probably

--

### Should you worry about the difference between what is technically a function and what is technically a method?

--

At this point, I wouldn't worry about it

---
layout: true

# More Features

---


--

### - create a function to calculate tax (0.13 * the total bill)

--

### - what else could be separated out into their own functions?

--
- a separate function to print the line

--
- a separate function responsible for formatting the total amount

--
- separating the calculating and printing into distinct functions

---
layout: true

# Fancy Bill
