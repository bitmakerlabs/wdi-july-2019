These short exercises will help you reinforce the concepts of data types, variables, and conditionals.

## Prerequisites
You should have already completed [the first assignment on variables, data types, and conditionals](https://git.generalassemb.ly/wdi-toronto/course-materials/blob/master/06-programming-fundamentals-part-1/assignments/programming-fundamentals/README.md) before moving on to this one.

## Film Recommendations

### Exercise 1

Think of a documentary, a drama, a comedy, and a dramedy.  Store the titles of these films in variables.  Ask the user if they enjoy 1. documentaries 2. dramas 3. comedies.  If they answer yes to documentaries, display a message recommending the documentary to them.  If they answer no to documentaries but yes to dramas and comedies, recommend the dramedy.  If they answer yes to only dramas, recommend the drama.  If they say yes to only comedies, recommend the comedy.  If they answer no to all three, recommend a good book instead.

### Exercise 2

Let's take a different approach to film recommendations: create the same variables containing your potential film recommendations and then ask the user to rate their appreciation for 1. documentaries 2. dramas 3. comedies on a scale from one to five.  If they rate documentaries four or higher, recommend the documentary.  If they rate documentaries 3 or lower but both comedies and dramas 4 or higher, recommend the dramedy.  If they rate only dramas 4 or higher, recommend the drama.  If they rate just comedies 4 or higher, recommend the comedy.  Otherwise, recommend a good book.

#### Stretch Challenge

If they didn't rate any genre higher than 3 but they did rate one genre higher than the other two, recommend the film from that genre.
