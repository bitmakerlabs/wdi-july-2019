This assignment is a series of drills meant to reinforce your knowledge of the box model.

## Prerequisites
* HTML and CSS fundamentals

## Learning Goals
* the box model: content, padding, border, margin

## Part 1

On a piece of paper, draw, label and describe a diagram of the box model (for a single element).  This is something you should get comfortable doing, both for the purposes of reinforcing the concept to yourself but also in preparation for front-end interview questions.

## Part 2

Open [this code pen](http://codepen.io/fightingtheboss/pen/VKNXgE) and create a fork of it by hitting the "fork" button at the top of the page (you'll have to create a Codepen account in order to do this).  In your forked copy, experiment with changing the values in the CSS to familiarize yourself with the following properties:

* margin
* padding
* border
* box-sizing
* width
* height

## Submitting

When you're done, submit the link to your forked Codepen instead of a github repo for this assignment.
