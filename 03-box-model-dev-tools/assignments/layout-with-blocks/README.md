## Getting started

1. Setup a new folder in your `projects` folder called `css-display-layout`
2. Create a repository on GitHub and sync them together
3. Create an `index.html` for your markup and a `styles.css` for your styles
4. Open `index.html` in your browser
5. Open your Developer Tools
6. Do your best to recreate the design in the image!

## A note on browser size
This design will look different depending on the width of your browser! That's totally cool! Try resizing your browser to see how it affects the layout. We'll look into how we can control this a bit better soon enough.

## Adding placeholder images
In this example, we're using placeholder images from https://unsplash.it. To add placeholder images to your design:

1. Add an `img` tag to your document
2. In the `src` attribute, add a URL with the following format: `https://unsplash.it/{add_pixel_width_here}/{add_pixel_height_here}?random={add_a_random_number_here}`

eg. https://unsplash.it/200/400?random=1234567



*Don't forget to submit when you're done!*
