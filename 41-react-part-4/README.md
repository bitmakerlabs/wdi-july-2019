# Intro to React: Day 4

## Overview
Today we'll learn about consuming API data within React applications. We'll do
this through a combination of discussion, and by building an application that
consumes the Marvel API.

## Exercise: React Marvel API
The starter code for today's exercise lives in the `instructor/` and `student/`
directories. Additionally, the exercise is also available in a stand-alone
repository: [react-marvel-api][React Marvel API].

If you're participating in the 'code-along' during the morning session, feel
free to work in the `student/` directory.

If you're working on this exercise as part of the afternoon session, fork and
clone the [react-marvel-api][React Marvel API] repository to prevent conflicts
with other learners.
